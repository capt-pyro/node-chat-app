# node-chat-app

Exprerimenting with Socket.io to create a basic chat application. Has a login page that requires email and chat room name. Messages in a chatroom are kept private. Messages aren't persistant so new users can't see old messages, but the next version will store data in database. Project is hosted on heroku.
